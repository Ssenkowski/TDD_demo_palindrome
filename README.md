- Test a word to see if it's a Palindrome

- Examples:  madam, level, deed, dad, mom etc.



Test steps:

Reverse the initial string

Compare the new reversed string to the original

If the new string matches letter for letter the old string it's a Palindrome.

If not, it's of course not a Palindrome.



Methods and variables needed: 

Two variables:

1. original
2. reversed_string

Methods: 
.reverse (returns a new string with the characters from the original string reversed)
